""""
This program is to display the characters in the ASCII character table from ! to ~ based on the following criteria:

    1. This program is to display ten characters per line.
    2. The characters are separated by exactly one space.

Date: 10/03/2024

Functions:
    ord() - Return the Unicode code point for a one-character string.
    chr() - Return the string representing a character whose Unicode code point is the integer i.
    range() - Return an object that produces a sequence of integers from start (inclusive) to stop (exclusive) by step.
