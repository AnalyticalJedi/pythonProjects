"""
    This is a program that prompts the user to enter the coordinates of two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) and displays the line equation in the slope
- intercept form (y = mx + b) based on the following criteria:

1. prompts the user to enter the coordinates of two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2)
2. verifies the input to ensure:
     #m is not displayed if equal to 1
     #b is not displayed if equal to 0
#3. use conditional statements to determine the slope and intercept of the line
#4. print the line equation in the slope - intercept form (y = mx + b)
