"""
    The goal of this assignment was to write a program that displays the area and perimeter of a rectangle.
    Demonstrated below shows the process of obtaining the correct results below. 

Functions:
    The area of a rectangle can be computed by the formula: area = width * height
    The perimeter of a rectangle can be computed by the formula: perimeter = 2 * (width + height)
    
"""
#Define the width and height of the rectangle
width = 4.5
height = 7.9 

#Calculate the area
area = width * height
area = 4.5 * 7.9
print(area)

#Calculate the perimeter
perimeter = 2 * (width + height)
perimeter = 2 * (4.5 + 7.9)
print(perimeter)

#Display the results
print(area)
print(perimeter)

#Output
