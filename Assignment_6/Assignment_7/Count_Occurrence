Program: Count Occurrence of Numbers

Description: This program reads a single line of integers from the user, with each integer separated by a space. It then counts the occurrences of each unique number between 1 and 100 and displays the results.

Functions:
    - get_user_input(): Prompts the user for input and returns a list of integers.
    - count_occurrences(numbers): Takes a list of integers, filters those between 1 and 100, and returns a dictionary with each number as a key and its count as the value.
    - display_counts(count_dict): Takes a dictionary of counts and displays each number and its occurrence count.

Input:
     - A single line of integers separated by spaces (e.g., "5 7 5 100 23 5").
     - Each integer should be between 1 and 100. Values outside this range will be ignored.
 
Output:
     - For each unique integer (within the range), the program will print the number and the count of times it appears.
