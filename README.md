## Project Descriptions

### 1. ASCII Character Table Display
- **File**: `ascii_code.py`
- **Description**: Displays the characters in the ASCII table from `!` to `~`, formatted to show 10 characters per line, separated by a single space.
- **Skills Demonstrated**: Iterative logic, string manipulation.

### 2. Bank Account Simulator
- **File**: `annual_interest_rate.py`
- **Description**: Simulates a bank account with functionality to deposit, withdraw, and calculate monthly interest based on an annual interest rate.
- **Skills Demonstrated**: Class creation, encapsulation, accessor/mutator methods.

### 3. Area and Perimeter of a Rectangle
- **File**: `area_perimeter_rectangle.py`
- **Description**: Calculates the area and perimeter of a rectangle given its dimensions.
- **Skills Demonstrated**: Basic mathematical operations.

### 4. Count Occurrence of Numbers
- **File**: `count_occurrence.py`
- **Description**: Reads integers from the user, counts occurrences of numbers between 1 and 100, and displays the counts.
- **Skills Demonstrated**: Dictionary manipulation, user input validation.

### 5. File Content Counter
- **File**: `counter.py`
- **Description**: Counts the number of lines, words, and characters in a user-specified text file.
- **Skills Demonstrated**: File handling, error handling, text processing.

### 6. Daily Sales Calculator
- **File**: `daily_total_sales.py`
- **Description**: Calculates total sales for each day of the week based on pie prices and quantities sold.
- **Skills Demonstrated**: Matrix operations, nested loops.

### 7. Extended String Manipulation (MyString)
- **File**: `first_last_occurrence.py`
- **Description**: Extends Pythonâ€™s `str` class to add methods for finding the first and last occurrence of a character within a string.
- **Skills Demonstrated**: Class inheritance, method overriding.

### 8. Grade Calculator
- **File**: `grade_calculator.py`
- **Description**: Calculates and outputs a grade based on a user-provided exam score.
- **Skills Demonstrated**: Conditional logic, input validation.

### 9. Sum of Digits
- **File**: `integer_reading.py`
- **Description**: Adds all digits in an integer between 0 and 1000 and displays the result.
- **Skills Demonstrated**: Looping, modular arithmetic.

### 10. Line Equation Calculator
- **File**: `slope_intercept.py`
- **Description**: Calculates the slope and y-intercept of a line based on two points, outputting the equation in slope-intercept form.
- **Skills Demonstrated**: Mathematical calculations, conditional logic.

### 11. Temperature Conversion Tool
- **File**: `tempConvTool.py`
- **Description**: Converts temperatures between Celsius and Fahrenheit with a text-based menu interface.
- **Skills Demonstrated**: Function definition, user interaction, modular programming.
