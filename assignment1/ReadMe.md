# ASCII Character Table Display

## Description
This program displays the characters in the ASCII character table from `!` to `~`, formatted with the following criteria:

1. Displays ten characters per line.
2. Characters are separated by exactly one space.

This project demonstrates Python's ability to work with Unicode values and sequence generation, utilizing built-in functions to process and display characters efficiently.

## Functions Used

- **`ord()`**: Returns the Unicode code point for a one-character string.
- **`chr()`**: Converts a Unicode code point to its corresponding character.
- **`range()`**: Generates a sequence of integers between specified start and stop values.

---

## Features

- Displays characters from the ASCII range `!` (33) to `~` (126).
- Formats the output with exactly 10 characters per line.
- Uses efficient looping and built-in Python functions to process the ASCII range.
